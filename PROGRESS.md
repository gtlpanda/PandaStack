# Phase 1 progress

Planning and frozen acceptance preparation; no features implemented.

## P1-01 implementation — 2026-11-09

Implemented `core/skills/run-records/records.mjs`: versioned run/event validation,
settings and provenance allowlists, safe INVALID_RECORD construction errors,
nonmutating defaults, absolute paths, identifiers, revisions, UTC calendar dates,
and lifecycle exit-code agreement. Added run-records SKILL.md and five focused
implementation test groups in `tests/run-records.test.mjs`, automatically included
by the existing workflow harness. No dependency or runner behavior changes.

Verification on Node v24.21.0:
- `node acceptance/phase1/p1-01.test.mjs`: exit 0, 4 passed / 0 failed.
- `node --test acceptance/phase1/p1-01.test.mjs`: exit 0.
- Focused import of `tests/run-records.test.mjs` with workflow-harness `summary()`
  setting the exit code: exit 0, 5 passed / 0 failed.
- `bash scripts/validate.sh`: exit 0, VALIDATE: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: exit 0.
- `bash scripts/test.sh`: interrupted with exit 130 after reporting frozen CLI
  test failures and `Error: listen EPERM: operation not permitted 127.0.0.1` in
  the workflow suite; autobuild tests had not completed. Some CLI failures showed
  empty stdout (for example expected `BACKLOG: PASS`, actual empty string).
  No full regression pass claimed. Full captured output is at
  `/tmp/pandastack-p1-01-tests.log` in this session. Frozen tests and sandbox
  controls were not changed to bypass these failures.

Read-only Explore review: PASS for data flow, edge/error handling, security,
consistency, and missing pieces; no concrete P1-01 issues found. Decisions D9-D10
record implementation choices. Host retains commits, feature passes, full gate
verification, live dogfood evidence, and roadmap completion. No flags or frozen
inputs changed; P1-02 through P1-04 remain outside this iteration.

## P1-02 implementation — 2026-11-09

Implemented `core/skills/run-records/store.mjs`: synchronous immutable run/event
storage, atomic exclusive hard-link publication, file/directory fsync, content-based
replay and conflicts, exact filters, deterministic ordering, run-scoped event IDs,
strict corruption detection, and symlink refusal. Invalid IDs fail before filesystem
access. Ordinary publication failures clean temporary files and return safe coded
errors. Seven focused store test groups in `tests/run-store.test.mjs` use the existing
workflow harness and are included by its normal test discovery. No dependencies,
provider calls, runner behavior changes, frozen inputs, or git controls changed.

Targeted verification:
- `node acceptance/phase1/p1-02.test.mjs`: exit 0, 3 passed / 0 failed, including
  eight independent writer processes.
- `node --input-type=module -e "await import('./tests/run-store.test.mjs'); await import('./tests/run-records.test.mjs'); const {summary}=await import('./scripts/workflow-harness.mjs'); const result=summary(); console.log(result); process.exitCode=result.fail ? 1 : 0"`:
  exit 0, 12 passed / 0 failed (seven store groups and five record groups).
- Store tests additionally verify distinct concurrent runs, competing event contents,
  failure cleanup, safe error messages, malformed data, symlinked ancestors/events,
  lexical ID ties, and fractional timestamp ordering without millisecond truncation.
- `git diff --check`: exit 0.

Read-only Explore review identified event ordering issues for mixed-case IDs and
sub-millisecond timestamps. Both were fixed with focused regression coverage before
final targeted verification. Decisions D11-D12 record storage choices. Full gates,
commits, feature flags, live dogfood, and roadmap completion remain owned by the
external host; no full gate or later-phase acceptance was run this iteration.
Final Explore re-review: PASS for data flow, edge/error handling, security,
consistency, and missing pieces; both ordering findings confirmed resolved.

## P1-03 implementation — 2026-11-09

Implemented effective configuration doctor and CLI with shared managed model
precedence, provider-specific role/effort provenance, safe configuration errors,
read-only generated drift detection, tri-state capability evidence, managed binary
selection/PATH, bounded version-only probing, strict CLI parsing, and exit mapping.
Added seven workflow-harness implementation test groups, automatically discovered
by normal CI. README and run-records skill document scope and limitations.

Targeted evidence on Node v24.21.0:
- `node --input-type=module -e "await import('./tests/run-doctor.test.mjs'); const {summary}=await import('./scripts/workflow-harness.mjs'); const result=summary(); console.log(result); process.exitCode=result.fail ? 1 : 0"`: exit 0; 7 passed, 0 failed.
- `node acceptance/phase1/p1-03.test.mjs`: exit 1; 2 API tests passed,
  CLI subprocess test failed with `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input` at
  p1-03.test.mjs:46. A direct spawnSync reproduction reported `EPERM`, status 2,
  and empty stdout/stderr for the Node child. No acceptance pass claimed; host
  must rerun outside these sandbox process restrictions.
- In-process CLI tests verify malformed arguments, JSON output, and paths with
  spaces without relying on subprocess permission. No full gate was run.

Read-only Explore review: model precedence, Claude effort/force semantics, drift,
safe errors, bounded probing, evidence normalization, and CLI parsing passed.
Review caught explicit null Codex effort being defaulted incorrectly; it now fails
validation, with regression coverage. Review also caught missing explicit binaries
being masked by injected evidence; explicit paths now fail the prerequisite even
with an injected probe, with regression coverage. Bare-name injected probes own
discovery as required for isolated acceptance fixtures; default probes always
resolve executables locally. No provider/model calls, frozen input edits, feature
flags, commits, or roadmap completion. Supervisor owns live evidence and full gates.
